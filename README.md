# Virtual-Cybersecurity-Lab
A fully functional virtual cybersecurity lab built for hands-on learning, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and secure network simulation in a controlled environment using ethical hacking tools and isolated virtual machines.
Virtual Cybersecurity Lab Setup

## Project Summary  
This report documents the step-by-step development of a virtual cybersecurity lab designed for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and simulated cyber defense. The lab includes attacker and target machines, a web application testing environment, and essential tools for ethical hacking. The project demonstrates virtualization, network segmentation, vulnerability analysis, and secure lab setup.

## Project Overview  
The virtual lab simulates a secure, isolated environment where cybersecurity techniques can be practiced without harming real-world systems. It features a structured layout of virtual machines connected within a private network to simulate attacks and defenses.

## Objectives  
- Simulate a cybersecurity environment for training  
- Practice ethical hacking techniques safely  
- Conduct vulnerability assessments  
- Gain experience using cybersecurity tools

## Tools and Environment  
- Virtualization platform  
- Penetration testing operating system  
- Vulnerable target machine  
- Web application testing platform  
- Network analysis tools

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide  

#### 1. Preparation  
- Verified system virtualization support  
- Enabled virtualization in BIOS or UEFI  
- Installed virtualization software

#### 2. Creating Virtual Machines  
- Created VM for penetration testing  
- Created VM for target system  
- Configured system resources for each machine

#### 3. Network Configuration  
- Created internal or host-only network  
- Assigned static IPs to each VM  
- Verified connectivity using ping

#### 4. Installing Tools  
- Installed port scanning and vulnerability tools  
- Installed traffic analyzers and interception proxies  
- Set up web-based vulnerable applications

#### 5. Testing and Simulation  
- Performed reconnaissance on target  
- Conducted controlled web attacks  
- Captured network traffic for analysis  
- Documented all procedures and results
